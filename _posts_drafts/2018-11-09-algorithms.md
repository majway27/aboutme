## Functional Concept - Algorithms



##### - In the weeds -
- Big-oh notation is a common way of expressing a computer code's performance. 
- The notation creates a relationship between the number of items in memory and the average performance for a function. 
- For a set of {\displaystyle n} n items, {\displaystyle O(n)} O(n) indicates that a particular function will operate on the set {\displaystyle n} n times on average. 
- {\displaystyle O(1)} O(1) indicates that the function always performs a constant number of operations regardless of the number of items. 
- The notation only represents algorithmic complexity so a function may perform more operations but constant multiples of {\displaystyle n} n are dropped by convention.

## Searching

## Binary Search

## Greediness
