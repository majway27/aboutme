Editor Note:
- The material below was cobbled together for personal use, from attributed sources, and endured some mild look/feel massage.
- Document Purpose: Conveniently scoped refresher on the listed Linux material.

## The Linux Kernel
### Knowledge Targets
- Utilize kernel components that are necessary to specific hardware, hardware drivers, system resources and requirements. 
- Implement different types of kernel images, identifying stable and development kernels and patches, 
as well as using kernel modules.
- Focus on standard way of doing things.

Servers:
- Centos - 2.x.x kernel tree
- Debian - 3.x kernel tree

### 201.1 Kernel Components
#### Kernel Source and Documentation
- Weighting of 2 on LPIC2, so only expect a couple questions.
- Kernel source is typically not installed by default
- Challenge - each distro has special additional steps that differs from others.
**Centos**
- `uname -a` to see current kernel 
- `/usr/src/kernel`, - `yum install kernel-devel`.  When this completes, a folder for current kernel in this dir. 
- LPIC2 Exam - requires general steps for building a kernel
- Documentation
  - 2.x and older, docs separate.  3.x+ docs come with.
  - Default: `usr/src/linux/documentation`, or possibly (centos) `/usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-<version>/Documentation`.
  - Often online doc will point you to a file in here.
 **Debian**
 - `apt install source linux-image-$(uname -r)`
 - `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-36/Documentation`

#### Components
- Boot directory `/boot` 
- vmlinuz is the actual kernel itself
- Z-image (compressed image of your kernel)
  - Low memory sized image to support older systems with 512kb limit
- On modern distros (2.0+)
  - "BZ image type", aka "Big Z Image".  High-memory image.
  - Since 2.6, uses better compressing bzip2
- 4.0+ xz compression.  XZ is better compression ratio, but slower.  Uses more resources.

### 201.2 Compiling Kernel
#### Prep - Dependencies
Centos
- Group Install
  - `yum groupinstall "Development Tools`
- Others
  - ncurses-devel, qt-devel, etc
  
Your going to need a bigger boat for all the devel libraries needed (99-ish)

Debian
- `apt install make gcc lib-ncurses5-dev`
- `apt install build-dep linux-image-$(uname-r)`
- ex: `cd /usr/src/linux-headers-3.xx.x-xx`
- Make
  - make distclean, make mrproper, make clean
  
#### Compiling
