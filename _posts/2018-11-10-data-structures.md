## Functional Concept - {{page.topic-variable}}
##### - Basics -
- Formal data structures enable a programmer to mentally structure large amounts of data into conceptually manageable relationships.
- Sometimes we use data structures to allow us to do more: for example, to accomplish fast searching or sorting of data. 
- Other times, we use data structures so that we can do less: for example, the concept of the stack is a limited form of a more general data structure. 
- These limitations provide us with guarantees that allow us to reason about our programs more easily. 
- Data structures also provide guarantees about algorithmic complexity â€” choosing an appropriate data structure for a job is crucial for writing good software.

##### - In the weeds -
### Arrays


### Linked Lists
- In computer science, a Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures.
  - Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. 
- In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. 
  - This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.
- They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis.

### Stacks
- In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
  - push, which adds an element to the collection, and
  - pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

### Queues

### Hash-sets

### Hash-maps

### Hash-tables

### Dictionaries

### Binary Trees
