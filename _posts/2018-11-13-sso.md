## Functional Concept - {{page.topic-variable}}
##### - Basics - Federated Identity
- The concept of a centralized or linked electronic identity is known as federated identity. Federated identity systems handle several concerns:
  - Authentication
    - Deals with validating user crede
    ntials and establishing the identity of the user.
  - Authorization
    - Related to access restrictions (e.g., is the user allowed to access X resource?).
  - User attributes exchange
    - Deals with data sharing across different user management systems. 
    - For instance, fields such as "real name" may be present in multiple systems. 
  - User management
    - Related to the administration (creation, deletion, update) of user accounts.
