### GTO
#### Summary: 
- Upgrades and repairs.  
  - Electronic ignition module to replace mechanical points.  Ignition coil.  Carb rebuild.
  - Brake system major system overhaul (full system replacement(booster, master, all lines, calipers, drums, fluid)).

#### Mistakes/Failures: 
- Ignition System
  - Multiple changes created more difficult troubleshooting post installation.
    - Install was sound, carb linkages were altered during reassembly creating a fuel tuning issue that masked as a spark problem
- Brakes
  - Multiple changes created more difficult troubleshooting post installation.
    - Bleeding a full system replacement with all new lines was new and hard.
    - Freak issue with seating/sealing front caliper hoses onto caliper body 

#### Enjoyed: 
Ignition
 - Reduction in complexity and mechanical decay factor.
 - Improved "Spring Shakeout" experience going forward.

Brakes
- Major increase in safety and reliability
- Some braking performance improvement

Learning
- Big learning experience, very rewarding.

#### Leadership: N/A
#### Conflicts:
- Time
- Post installation troubleshooting was timing consuming, demoralizing, and draining.

#### Do differently:
More discipline around isolating changes.  This is challenging b/c of mechanical assembly time costs.
